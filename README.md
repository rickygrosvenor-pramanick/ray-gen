# ray-gen
RayGen provides reproducible scripts to synthesize labelled radiographs, filter obvious artefacts, train a lightweight ResNet, fine-tune on a small real subset, and benchmark AUROC against a real-only baseline. Use it to explore synthetic data augmentation, rapid prototyping under strict privacy constraints, and the practical limits of diffusion-based domain transfer.
